# Utilizing the SIR Model to Simulate the Spread of an Epidemic: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach

## Abstract: 
In light of recent global pandemics such as COVID-19, a thorough understanding of how quickly an epidemic can spread under various conditions remains critical. While both mathematical (differential equation-based) and computational (agent-based) models are commonly utilized in the simulation of large-scale epidemics, the agent-based modeling approach has proven to be more flexible, especially when there are varying input parameters involved. This paper demonstrates how to simulate the spread of an epidemic using the agent-based approach combined with the SIR model framework. Additionally, the effects of various parameters including the infection probability, length of the infectious period, and sample size on the epidemic outcomes were also measured. It was found that in all three cases, an increase in each parameter led to a higher number of daily and total infections, as well as a longer epidemic overall.
